# hw-01-code-refactor

This is a project in which I recieved an existing HTML and CSS file that was functional, however was tasked to refactor the code so that it was condensed, more efficient, easier to edit for fellow coders, and easier to read. 

# Installation

I pulled the files from Github from the gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020 repo. From there I copied the files from assets which included the existing index.html and style.css which were used for editing purposes. The files were edited using VS CODE. Finally the refactored code was submitted to the hw-01-code-refactor on my Git Hub profile.

# Usage
The refactored files have the same functionality as the intial code, however have been reformatted so that it is more distinguishable.
